# Response to PAPER_REVIEW_AUDIT (cumulative)

This response file is cumulative, mirroring `PAPER_REVIEW_AUDIT.md`: each audit run gets a
timestamped response section below. The newest section always addresses the audit's newest
"Audit Run" section and its updated risk list.

## Response — to Audit Run 2026-07-12 04:28 (responded 2026-07-12, same day)

Verdict received: narrow scientific core "still conditionally acceptable"; artifact package
"minor revision" — documentation/manifest hygiene only, no result findings. All three confirmed
problems fixed; both open questions answered below.

### Confirmed problems

| # | Finding | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stale "163 cells" prose in `CANONICAL_SUBMISSION.md` and the round-3 response | Fixed maintenance-free: `CANONICAL_SUBMISSION.md` now states the gate's **invariants** (0 mismatch / 0 untraceable / 12 required families) and defers the exact cell count to the strict build's own output ("164 at this writing, grows as evidence lands") — so the canonical file cannot go stale again when cells are added. The three historical responses (round 3, round 2, full-method) carry a one-time annotation marking their counts as point-in-time. |
| 2 | New Office HSTU-BLaIR run artifacts not in `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` scope | Fixed with the hash option, generalized: the manifest gains a **`reference_runs` section hashing the artifacts of all three local reference-implementation runs** (metrics.jsonl, run_meta.json, gin copy, intended-TB pointer, trainer log — 15 files), and `update_release_manifest.py --verify` treats them as git-tracked (missing or drifted ⇒ gate failure). Strict wrapper re-run: **RELEASE MANIFEST VERIFY: OK (111 files verified)**. |
| 3 | Untracked render scratch could be swept into a release | `/_paper_render.html` and `/tmp/` explicitly gitignored with a "never release-swept" comment; the deposit bundle is assembled from an explicit file list (`make_deposit` inventory), never from a directory sweep. |

### Open questions — answered

- **Should `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` include all local reference-run artifacts, or is git
  tracking + `hstu_results_manifest.json` the provenance layer?** Both, with an explicit
  boundary now written into the manifest: the *source* run artifacts are hash-manifested
  (`reference_runs`), while the two *generated* JSONs (`hstu_results_manifest.json`,
  `hstu_tables.json`) are deliberately outside the hash scope — a new
  `generated_artifacts_note` field explains why: they are git-tracked build outputs whose
  integrity check **is** the fail-closed gate itself, and the strict wrapper rewrites
  `hstu_tables.json` during the same run that verifies hashes, so hash-pinning them would make
  verification circular.
- **Will the next deposited release include the Office HSTU-BLaIR artifacts?** Yes — they are
  repository-tracked and now release-manifest-hashed; they ride into the next deposit bundle
  cut (e.g., at DOI minting time). The existing `v1.0-deposit` bundle predates the run and says
  so via its manifest boundary.
- **Target venue/template?** Maintainer decision, still pending; acknowledged as the final
  pre-submission step (risk 5).

### Standing risks (3–5) — discipline confirmed

- **"Regenerates" vs "reproduces" (risk 3):** wording frozen as "environment-caveated
  single-run regenerations" in both papers, `CANONICAL_SUBMISSION.md` (with an explicit
  non-strengthening rule), and every relevant manifest cell note. The §5.6 caveat paragraph
  keeps the three-way distinction (published point / unpinned local regeneration / faithful
  pinned reproduction — the last one never claimed) and will not be shortened.
- **No broad SOTA, no paired superiority (risk 4):** unchanged and enforced by the standing
  forbidden-wordings list; the claim set may only narrow.
- **Venue formatting (risk 5):** deferred to venue choice; table values will remain generated
  from JSON.

### Verification after fixes

`rebuild_hstu_submission.py --strict` → parity OK → **SUBMISSION BUILD GREEN (164 cells, 0
mismatch, 0 untraceable, 12/12 families)** → **RELEASE MANIFEST VERIFY: OK (111 files)** → MI
dual gate PASS → Office VOID/descriptive → **SUBMISSION REBUILD: PASS**, exit 0. Papers
untouched this round (no re-render needed; PDF still 37 pp, scan clean).
